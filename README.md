# Mahalo Makani

A Flutter project for the Brother Hackathon 2022.

## Mini-Hackathon #1.

Makani (the “wind”) is a friendly handyman in Molokai. He is famous for
his Nothing-More-Than-$10 service fee! Everyone calls him “tutu kane
Makani” or Grandpa Makani. He is seeking help with a simple invoicing
app. This will help him keep track of his finance and perhaps grow his
small business.

Can you help Makani? He will most definitely give you a big “Mahalo!”

# Brother Hackathon

Feel free to use any of my GitHub repositories in your apps. You should also consider
attending the free Brother Hackathon happening this year. You get a free Brother QL-1110NWB,
a PT-P910BT, and possibly an awesome DS-940DW mobile scanner. Visit brotherhackathon.com for
more information. I will be teaching workshops, and they are free. You can ask me any questions.
Thank you.
